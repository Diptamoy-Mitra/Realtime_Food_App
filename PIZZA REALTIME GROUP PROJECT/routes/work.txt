The meaning of routes is : suppose you have hosted your project using liveserver. A fixed domain is provided, so if you have static project then you can see changes in url:

ex: 
 >. localhost: 3000/   >> home url, initial home page. Their is no domain name that means it domain name is "/"

>> now suppose, you have gone to your login page:

>. localhost: 3000/login     >>here its domain name is /login 



*So to manage all the urls we have to do some min configaretions this configuretion is called routes*
